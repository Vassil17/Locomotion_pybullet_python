# locomotion_nmpc_pybullet_python

Build the pybullet simulation environment for legged robots motion planning and control(coding by python.3.6)

run "talos_nmpc_ik.py" for robot locomotion control

The Pinocchio dynamic library is used for robot-computation: 

Note: the .exe library (generated by external c++ code, see github repo: "locomotion_nmpc_pybullet") is employed for fast gait planing and optimization.
