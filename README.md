# locomotion_nmpc_pybullet_python

Build the pybullet simulation environment for legged robots motion planning and control(coding by python.3.6)

The Pinocchio dynamic library is used for robot-computation

Note: the .exe library (generated by external c++ code, see github repo: "locomotion_nmpc_pybullet"
) is employed for fast gait planing and optimization.
